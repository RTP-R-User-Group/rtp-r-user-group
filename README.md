# rtp-r-user-group

This GitHub page is a collaborative space for the RTP R User group organizers (Nicholas Masel (nicholas-masel) and Natalia Andriychuk (nandriychuk)).

## Decisions to be made:

1.  Group Name (suggestions below):

    -   RTP useR Group

    -   RTP R users

    -   RTP R User Group

        -   This name is consistent with everything I see on <https://www.meetup.com/pro/r-user-groups>

2.  Group purpose and goals:

    -   Purpose: What do we want to accomplish?

        -   Community: bring people of like interests together

        -   Learning: learn something new that would help your professions and/or passions

    -   Goals: What do we need to do a accomplish the items above?

        -   #3-6 cover what we need to do to achieve our purpose.

3.  How often will we meet:

    If we choose to have hybrid meetings (F2F and virtual )

    -   Monthly if we can handle it, otherwise quarterly meets minimum requirements for grant

4.  Meeting format:

    -   Virtual: Zoom/Google Meet

    -   F2F:

        -   Locations for f2f meetings:

            -   [Public Coworking \| Frontier RTP](https://frontier.rtp.org/coworking/)

5.  Meeting Structure:

    -   Presentations

    -   Invited guests Q&A (similar to DS Hangout)

    -   Book Club

6.  Engagement and Marketing:

    -   Event invitation

    -   Logo (<https://www.canva.com/>)

    -   Who will be a part of the community?

        -   Pharma, CRO, Academia

            -   As non-pharma industry folks join, challenge them to bring relevant non-pharma topics and colleagues. Address this bias during meetings and provide a clear, easy way for others to volunteer and/or present.

        -   Non-R users, i.e. SAS users?

            -   Industry is presently shifting and this R group can support them as they add R to their toolbelt

        -   R users

    -   How do we get people engaged?

    -   How do we market it?

        -   Create linkedin post, email and calendar invite templates

        -   Identify champion within each local pharma/cro/university

        -   Leverage network and expand local network via conferences

    -   What should we talk about?

        -   Beginner, intermediate and/or advanced?

        -   Should this be based off our members? If so, survey members and use this to curate topics. Or poll on topics and present on winner.

        -   Updates for popular packages

        -   How should we collect proposed topics and/or speakers for future meetings?

    -   Standardize where possible

    -   Fit speakers into time slots, not make time slots for speakers
